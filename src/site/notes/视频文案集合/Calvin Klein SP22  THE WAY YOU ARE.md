[Calvin Klein SP22 | THE WAY YOU ARE](https://www.xinpianchang.com/a11811220?from=articleCollectDetail)
```
Where we're going
What are we looking for
I don't know
Just going on an adventure with people you connect with

Where we're going
I just like don't overthinking too much
You find moments in between, that touches your heart

Do you ever think about
you might only see this view once in your lifetime

Stopping once in a while is not so bad
You find moments in between, that touches your heart

What are we looking for

What are we going

Directly

And you never know, if you just act on them
you might find something new

I guess this is freedom
Just going on an adventure with people you connect with
And on the way
